```
All around the world
We can make time
Rompin' and a stompin'
'Cause I'm in my prime
Born in the north
And sworn to entertain ya
'Cause Im down for
The state of Pennsylvania
I try not to whine
But I must warn ya
Bout the girls
From California
Alabama baby
Said Hallelujah
Good God girl
I wish I knew ya
I know, I know for sure
That life is beautiful around
the world
I know, I know its you
You say hello and then I say I
do
Come back baby
'Cause I'd like to say
I've been around the world
Back from Bombay
Fox hole love
Pie in your face
Living in and out
Of a big fat suitcase
Bonafide ride
Step aside my Johnson
Yes I could
In the woods of Wisconsin
Wake up the cake
It's a lake she's kissin' me
As they do when
When they do in Sicily
I know I know for sure
That life is beautiful around
the world
I know I know its you
You say hello and then I say I
do
Where you want to go
Who you want to be
What you want to do
Just come with me
I saw God
And I saw the fountains
You and me girl
Sittin' in the Swiss Mountains
Me oh my O
Me and guy O
Freer than a bird
'Cause we're rockin' Ohio
Around the world
I feel dutiful
Take a wife
Cause life is beautiful
I know I know for sure
$%%&*^&^$#$@##%&^*(*(&%%^$%$
I know I know it's you
&*%^$#@#$%^&*&()**%%$#@#$%*%
Mother Russia do not suffer
I know you're bold enough
Ive been around the world
And I have seen your love
I know I know its you
You say hello then I say I do
