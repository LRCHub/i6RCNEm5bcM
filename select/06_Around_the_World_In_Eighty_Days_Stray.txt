Bromham

Together on our magic carpet ride
The great balloon it drifts towards the skies
Each wind that blew along our way
Would help us travel everyday
As we travel over land and sea
The sight below makes lovely scenery
The splashing waves, the rolling hills
The sailing ships, the wooden mills

Around the world in eighty days
Around the world, the clouds a maze
We'll take you to the sky
Together we will fly
When we got home, the people were amazed
This balloon could last for eighty days
It took us to the sky
Together we did fly
Around the world in eighty days
Around the world, the clouds a maze
We'll take you to the sky
Together we will fly

Around the world in eighty days
Around the world, the clouds a maze
We'll take you to the sky
Together we will fly
