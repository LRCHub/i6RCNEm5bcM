[00:16.34] Six o'clock in the morning
[00:18.72] You're the last to hear the warning
[00:21.27] You've been tryin' to throw your arms around the world
[00:26.61] You've been falling off the sidewalk
[00:29.35] Your lips move but you can't talk
[00:32.18] Tryin' to throw your arms around the world
[00:53.18] 
[00:37.34] Gonna run to you, run to you, run to you
[00:42.39] Be still
[00:47.86] Gonna run to you, run to you, run to you
[00:52.36] Woman I will (oh)

[01:01.28] Your head hurts and you can't breathe
[01:03.97] You've been tryin' to throw your arms around the world
[01:09.69] How far are you gonna go
[01:12.01] Before you lose your way back home?

[01:41.02] 
[01:41.23] Yeah I dreamed that I saw Dali
[01:44.25] With a supermarket trolley
[01:46.60] He was tryin' to throw his arms around a girl
[01:51.91] He took an open top beetle
[01:54.84] Through the eye of a needle
[01:57.50] He was tryin' to throw his arms around the world
[02:21.50] 
[02:02.74] I'm gonna run to you, run to you, run to you

[02:40.22] 
[02:45.63] Nothing much to say I guess
[02:48.21] Just the same as all the rest
[02:50.84] Been tryin' to throw your arms round the world
[02:56.08] And a woman needs a man
[02:58.70] Like a fish needs a bicycle
[03:01.48] When you're tryin' to throw your arms around the world
[03:28.48] 
[03:06.48] I'm gonna run to you, run to you, run to you
[03:11.95] I'm gonna run to you, run to you, run to you
